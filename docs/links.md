# DuckDb

https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/03/duckdb-is-the-most-impactful-geospatial-software-in-a-decade.html


In contrast to transactional queries (lots of small reads/writes like in banking apps), analytical queries focus on big reads, few writes, and complex calculations â€” like building reports, dashboards, or running data science workflows.

DuckDB is optimized for this by:

    Using a columnar storage format (read only the needed columns)

    Running operations in batches and in memory

    Applying vectorized execution (processes many rows at once)

In short: fast for reading and analyzing big datasets, not designed for frequent small updates.
