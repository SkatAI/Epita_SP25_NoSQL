# Guided Practice on MongoDB Atlas

In this document we will work on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database), a hosted MongoDB service to create a database, load documents and execute queries.

In a second part we will see how to work on larger databases with `mongosh` in the terminal.

At the end of this session, you should have a good understanding of MongoDB's query language (MQL).

Objectives:

- You connect to a MongoDB Atlas server
- You create a database and insert documents
- You build relatively complex queries on a MongoDB database

## Several ways to work with MongoDB

On your local machine

- [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/products/self-managed/community-edition) Self-hosted, runs on your computer
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) - the GUI tool for visualization
- [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/) the CLI (command line interface) in the terminal.

The MongoDB Shell, mongosh, is a JavaScript and Node.js **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for interacting with MongoDB servers.

You can also work on MongoDB with your preferred scripting language: [python](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/pymongo-tutorial), [go](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver), ruby, PHP, Java, etc...

Today, we are working on the hosted Atlas version.

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/cloud/atlas/try4-reg) provides a Cloud hosted service with free or paid offerings. **You don't have to install anything**.

MongoDB Atlas gives a hosted cluster on which we can create a database, import sample **collections** and understand how to perform CRUD operations in MongoDB.

> **CRUD** means Create, Read, Update and Delete: the four basic operations for a DBMS

## Atlas

Let's start by creating an account on Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>

Then:

- Create a cluster and a project (I called my project `Sandbox`)

![Create a cluster](./../img/create_new_cluster.png)

### Important

- **Copy your database password**.

- Check that your **IP** address is authorized. Visit `Network Access` (left navigation) and add it to the list
- To allow access from any IP add 0.0.0.0/0. This is not recommended for production but easier for our context.

![add IP address](./../img/atlas_add_ip_address.png)

### Then create a MongoDB database

- Go to `clusters`
- Create a database: add the name `songsdb` and the collection name `songs`,

Note: do not confuse

- the project: `Sandbox`
- the database: `songsdb`
- the collection (table): `songs`

Then insert the following Document

```json
{
  "_id":{
    "$oid":"6745ab6f0e0bbdab062667c7"
    },
    "title": "Happy",
    "artist": "Pharrell Williams",
    "year": 2013,
    "mood": "joyful"
}
```

![insert a document](./../img/atlas_insert_document.png)

And insert another one

```json
{
  "_id":{
    "$oid":"abcdeab6f0e0bbdab062667aa"
  },
  "title": "Highway to hell",
  "artist": "AC/DC",
  "year": 1981,
  "mood": "energetic"
}
```

In both cases, the value of the `_id` is arbitrary. The tool proposes a default one with another value.

We therefore have 2 documents!

2 documents, wow that's mega exciting ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ !

Let's explore this MongoDB database.

## Queries in MongoDB

In MongoDB, writing a query comes down to writing `JSON`

| json                           | query                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `{}`                           | returns all documents                |
| `{ field : value  }`           | where field = value                  |
| `{ field : { $lt : value }  }` | where field <= value (lt : less than) |

So if we want to find all documents in our `songs` collection, just write `{}` in the query field

This returns the 2 songs, the 2 documents.

![{} returns the whole dataset](./../img/query_musicdb.png)

And the query `{ year: { $lt: 2000 } }` returns the song that was published before 2000.

![{ year : {$lt : 2000} } published before 2000.](./../img/query_musicdb_year.png)

## Moooooore data! (moaaaaaarrrr data)

2 documents is good but we need more data to really play.

Let's now import the sample datasets provided by ATLAS.

Go to `Clusters > dots > load sample dataset`

![load sample dataset](./../img/atlas_load_sample_dataset.png)

Then click on your project name (for me `Sandbox`) and `Browse collections` to see the available databases.

You get a new database `movies_mflix` with 5 collections.

![Atlas sample databases](./../img/sample_datasetsets_atlas.png)

Look at the `embedded_movies` collection which contains 1525 documents and observe the structure of a document

**A document is a JSON record**

It can have:

- **nested JSON**: look at the nested dictionaries `imdb` and `tomatoes` fields.
- **arrays**: look at genres, cast, languages, writers, ...

**The primary key of a collection is always "`_id`".**

```json
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "573a1390f29313caabcd5293"

        }
    }
}
```

The ATLAS user interface is well done but I prefer working with code rather than a web interface.

Let's move to python and `mongosh` to explore this movie database and learn how to make queries in MongoDB.

## Connecting via your language

Atlas allows you to connect to your cluster

![connect to your cluster](./../img/connect_to_cluster.png)

## Reset and password management

If you forgot your cluster password

## Connecting with Mongosh

Save the connection string in an environment variable

```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster_id.mongodb.net/
```

For example

```sh
export MONGO_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://alexis:password@skatai.w932a.mongodb.net/
```

Then connect with

```sh
mongosh ${MONGO_ATLAS_URI}
```

### Connecting in Python

We need the [pymongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) package

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

The connection string is

```python
connection_string = "mongodb+srv://alexis:<db_password>@skatai.w932a.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=SkatAI"
```

Note: If you work in python, it's better to put the connection string as an environment variable (`$MONGO_ATLAS_URI`), in a `.env` file. then load it with `dotenv`

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

MONGO_ATLAS_URI = os.getenv('MONGO_ATLAS_URI')
```

And then instantiate the client with

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient(MONGO_ATLAS_URI)
```

Once we have a client, we can connect to the database

```python
db = client["sample_mflix"]
```

then instantiate a collection

```python
collection = db["movies"]
```

The collection is of class `pymongo.synchronous.collection.Collection` and has many methods:

![many collections methods](./../img/collection_many_methods.png)

### Using the terminal with `mongosh`

How to install `mongosh`: <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/>

The language used in the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`) is **JavaScript**.

`mongosh` is an interactive JavaScript interface for MongoDB, allowing you to interact with your MongoDB instances, execute queries or perform administrative tasks in JavaScript.

`mongosh` also supports many JavaScript features including the use of variables, loops and functions.

Here are some examples of using JavaScript in `mongosh`:

- **Connect to a MongoDB instance:**

Local

```sh
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

On Atlas

```sh
mongosh mongodb+srv://alexis:password@skatai-ipsa.w932a.mongodb.net/
```

or

```sh
mongosh ${MONGO_ATLAS_URI}
```

Once connected to an instance

- **see the databases:**

```javascript
show dbs
```

- **Change database:**

```javascript
use myDatabase
```

- **see the collections:**

```javascript
show collections
```

- **Insert a document**

```javascript
db.songs.insertOne(
    {
        "title": "Green Onions",
      "artist": "Booket T and the MGs",
      "year": 1967,
      "mood": "[blues, soul]"
  }
)
```

```js
db.users.updateOne(
{ "artist": "Booket T and the MGs" },
{ $set: { "artist": "Booker T and the MGs" } }
);
```

```js

db.songs.insertOne(
    {
    "title": "Happy",
    "artist": "Pharrell Williams",
    "year": 2013,
    "mood": "joyful"
})
```

![insert a document](./../img/atlas_insert_document.png)

And insert another one

```json
db.songs.insertOne(
    {
  "title": "Highway to hell",
  "artist": "AC/DC",
  "year": 1981,
  "mood": "energetic"
})
```

- **Execute a query**

```javascript
db.songs.find({ year: { $lt: 2000 } })
```

- **Update a document**

```javascript
db.myCollection.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
```

- **Delete a document:**

```javascript
db.myCollection.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
```

- **Use JavaScript variables and functions**

```javascript
var name = "Alice";
db.myCollection.find({ name: name }).forEach(printjson);
```

`mongosh` is a powerful tool for querying and managing your MongoDB databases.

### Difference between queries in python and javascript

python: double quotes around fields and operators

```python
db.movies.find(
    {"runtime": {"$gt" : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { "_id": 0, "title": 1, "runtime": 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

`mongosh`: no need for quotes

```js
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

### Filtering

<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/>

The JSON that specifies the filtering arguments is called a **query predicate**. It's an expression that returns a boolean indicating whether a document matches the specified query.

For example, `{ title: { $eq: "Top Gun" } }`, which returns documents that have a "`title`" field whose value is "`Top Gun`".

An empty query predicate (`{ }`) returns all documents in the collection.

Main functions on collections

| function              | returns                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `find()`              | all documents                                                                                    |
| `find_one()`          | the 1st document                                                                                 |
| `distinct("<field>")` | list of distinct values for the `<field>`                                                       |
| `count_documents({})` | number of documents for the collection or returned by the filter in the query predicate         |

Also note

- `find_one_and_replace()`
- `find_one_and_update()`
and

- `delete_many()`
- `delete_one()`
- `drop_index()`
- etc ...

Note: You can also query the collection directly from the client with `db.<collection_name>.find()` without having to instantiate a `collection` object.

```bash
collection.find({})
# or
db.movies.find({})
```

You can chain these methods with `limit` and `sort`

```bash
db.movies.find({runtime: {$gt: 120}}).limit(3)
```

### Cursor

The result returned is a **cursor**.

```js
cursor = db.movies.find({})
```

A cursor is a pointer to a MongoDB query result set.

### Projection

In database language, **projecting** means selecting a subset of all possible fields.

In SQL, you simply list the column names

```sql
select genres, plot from movies;
```

In MongoDB, you must specify the fields in a JSON object, right after the query predicate

```js
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

Here the projection is expressed by: `({ _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 })`

- `title: 1`: includes the title field.
- `runtime: 1,` includes the runtime
- `"imdb.rating": 1`: Includes the `imdb.rating` field.
- `_id: 0`: Excludes the `_id` field from the result (the default value is 1 if not specified).

The query returns

```json
  { runtime: 240, title: 'Napoleon', imdb: { rating: 7.4 } },
  { runtime: 281, title: 'Les MisÃ¨rables', imdb: { rating: 7.9 } },
  { runtime: 245, title: 'Flash Gordon', imdb: { rating: 7.3 } },
  { runtime: 238, title: 'Gone with the Wind', imdb: { rating: 8.2 } },
```

### Exercises

#### In python
Let's execute some queries in Python or `mongosh` on the `movies` database

```python
import os
from pymongo import MongoClient

connection_string = os.getenv('MONGO_ATLAS_URI')
client = MongoClient(connection_string)
db = client["sample_mflix"]
```

Then

- Retrieve the title and genres of movies that have the "Action" genre.

```python
cursor = db.movies.find(
    {"genres": "Action"},  # Filter: movies with 'Action' in the genres array
    {"_id": 0, "title": 1, "genres": 1}  # Projection: include title and genres, exclude _id
)
```

to see the results with python

```python
for movie in cursor:
    print(movie)
```

#### with `mongosh`:

once connected

```js
cursor = db.movies.find(
    {"genres": "Action"},  # Filter: movies with 'Action' in the genres array
    {"_id": 0, "title": 1, "genres": 1}  # Projection: include title and genres, exclude _id
)
```

### Number of documents

The fastest way to count documents is to use `count_documents`

```python
count = db.movies.count_documents({"imdb.rating": {"$gt": 8.0}})
```

> Note: in Python, you can clone the cursor to get its length and the number of returned documents.
> Cloning the cursor does not consume it

```python
len(list(cursor.clone()))
```

#### with mongosh

```js
db.movies.countDocuments({ "imdb.rating": { $gt: 8.0 } })
```

### Your turn

with

```python
cursor = db.movies.find( filter, projection).limit(5)
for movie in cursor:
    print(movie)
```

Write the filter and projection for the following queries and also return the number of documents with `db.movies.count_documents(filter)`

- use projection to return only relevant fields or at minimum "title"
- limit results to 5 documents

1. Find movies with an IMDb rating greater than 8
   - filter: `{"imdb.rating": {"$gt" : 8}}`
   - projection: `{"_id": 0, "title": 1, "imdb.rating": 1}`
2. Movies released after 2000
3. Movies with a specific director: "Christopher Nolan". Show title, director and year
4. Retrieve movies with `tomatoes.viewer.rating > 4.0`, showing title and viewer rating.
5. Find movies that contain `"Comedy"` and `"Drama"` in the `genres` array. Use `{$all: [list of genres]}`
6. Combine a query with sorting: Retrieve the top 5 movies with the highest IMDb rating, showing title and rating. (you should only retrieve `imdb.rating` with `double` data type)
7. Movie query on a year range: Retrieve movies released between 1990 and 2000, showing title and year.
8. Movie query with missing fields: Find movies where the `fullplot` field does not exist. Use `$exists`.
9. Find all distinct genres
   - use `db.movies.distinct("genres")`
10. Movies with at least 2 genres
    - use `{"genres": {$size: 2}}`
11. Action movies, after 1950 with imdb ratings > 8, sort by year desc, imdb rating desc
    - use `{
      "year": {$gt: 1950},
      "imdb.rating": {$gt: 8},
      "genres": "Action"
    }`
12. Movies with both genres: Action and Drama
    - `$and: [
        {"genres": "Action"},
        {"genres": "Drama"}
    ]`
13. Movies with either Action or Drama
    - `$or: [
        {"genres": "Action"},
        {"genres": "Drama"}
    ]`
14. Movies after 1950 with either imdb.rating > 0 or awards.wins > 5
    - use: `{
    "year": {$gt: 1950},
    $or: [
        {"imdb.rating": {$gt: 8}},
        {"awards.wins": {$gt: 5}}
    ]
}`
