# Guided Practice on MongoDB Atlas

In this document we will work on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database), a hosted MongoDB service to create a database, load documents and execute queries.

In a second part, we will see how to work on larger databases with `mongosh` in the terminal.

At the end of this session, you should have a good understanding of MongoDB's query language (MQL).

Objectives:

- Connect to a MongoDB Atlas server
- Create a database and insert documents
- Build relatively complex queries on a MongoDB database

## Working with MongoDB

There are several ways to work with MongoDB

On your local machine

- [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/products/self-managed/community-edition) Self-hosted, runs on your computer
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) - the GUI tool for visualization
- [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/) the CLI (command line interface) in the terminal.

The MongoDB Shell, mongosh, is a JavaScript and Node.js **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for interacting with MongoDB servers.

You can also work on MongoDB with your preferred scripting language: [python](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/pymongo-tutorial), [go](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver), ruby, PHP, Java, etc...

Today, we are working on the hosted Atlas version.

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/cloud/atlas/try4-reg) provides a Cloud hosted service with free or paid offerings. **You don't have to install anything**.

MongoDB Atlas gives a hosted cluster on which we can create a database, import sample **collections** and understand how to perform CRUD operations in MongoDB.

> **CRUD** means Create, Read, Update and Delete: the four basic operations for a DBMS

## Atlas

tldr; We're going to 1. create a cluster 2. create a database 3. add data. The trick is finding where to click on the UI. Then we'll explore the pre-loaded data sample that has more data.

## Account and Cluster
Let's start by creating an account on Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>

‚è±Ô∏è‚è±Ô∏è‚è±Ô∏è

Then:

- Create a cluster

![Create a cluster](./../img/create_new_cluster.png)


On the next screen
- select the free option (right side)
- and whatever cloud provider you like : Google, AWS or Azure
- select a region (default is ok)
- no need for tags
- Click on **"CREATE DEPLOYMENT"**
- I called the cluster : `Epita`

You can close the "Connect popup". We'll come back to it later.

### Important

- **Copy your database password**.

- Check that your **IP** address is authorized. Visit `Network Access` (left navigation) and add it to the list
- To allow access from any IP add 0.0.0.0/0. This is not recommended for production but easier for our context.

![add IP address](./../img/atlas_add_ip_address.png)

### Create a database

Then create a MongoDB database

- Go to `clusters` (left sise)
- click on "Browse Collections"
- then "Add my own data"

or in:

- Overview (Left)
- Add data (center)
- Create Database on Atlas


with following info

- database name: `songsdb`
- collection name `songs`
- no additional preferences


Note: do not confuse

- the project: `Sandbox` (already preset)
- the database: `songsdb`
- the collection (table): `songs`

Then insert the following Document (right side : INSERT DOCUMENT)

- click on {} (right side) to indicate you want to insert a document as JSON

you can delete the existing `_id`

```json
{
  "_id":{
    "$oid":"6745ab6f0e0bbdab062667c7"
    },
    "title": "Happy",
    "artist": "Pharrell Williams",
    "year": 2013,
    "mood": "joyful"
}
```

![insert a document](./../img/atlas_insert_document.png)

And insert another one

```json
{
  "_id":{
    "$oid":"682edb5c5ee7135cebb21b2f"
  },
  "title": "Galvanize",
  "artist": "The Chemical Brothers",
  "year": 2004,
  "mood": "electric"
}
```

In both cases, the value of the `_id` is arbitrary. The tool proposes a default one with another value.

We now have 2 documents!

2 documents, WOOOOOO!  exciting ü§£ü§£ü§£ !

Let's explore this magnificent MongoDB database.

## Queries in MongoDB

In MongoDB, writing a query comes down to writing `JSON`

| json                           | query                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `{}`                           | returns all documents                 |
| `{ field : value  }`           | where field = value                   |
| `{ field : { $lt : value }  }` | where field <= value (lt : less than) |

To return all the documents in our `songs` collection, just write `{}` in the "Filter" query field

This returns the 2 songs, the 2 documents.

![{} returns the whole dataset](./../img/query_musicdb.png)

And the query `{year : {$lt : 2010}}` returns the song that was published before 2010.

![{ year : {$lt : 2010} } published before 2010.](./../img/query_musicdb_year.png)

## Moaaaaaarrrr data!!!

![We want more data](./../img/memes/moar3.jpg)


2 documents is good but we need more data to really play.

Let's now import the sample datasets provided by ATLAS.

Note: it may be already loaded. Check in `Clusters` > `Browse Collections`.

If you do not see the database sample_mflix in the collection list then load it.

Go to `Clusters > dots > load sample dataset`

![load sample dataset](./../img/atlas_load_sample_dataset.png)

Keep everything or just select `sample_mflix` (may be faster)

‚è≥‚è≥‚è≥

Then click on `Clusters`) > `Browse collections` to see the available databases.

You get a new database `movies_mflix` with 5 collections.

![Atlas sample databases](./../img/sample_datasetsets_atlas.png)

Let's look at the `embedded_movies` collection which contains 1525 documents and observe the structure of a document

**A document is a JSON record**

It can have:

- **nested JSON**: look at the nested dictionaries `imdb` and `tomatoes` fields.
- **arrays**: look at genres, cast, languages, writers, ...

**The primary key of a collection is always "`_id`".**

```json

            }
        }
    }
}
```

The ATLAS user interface is well done but I prefer working with code rather than a web interface.

Let's move to `mongosh` to explore this movie database and learn how to make queries in MongoDB.

## Connecting via your language

Atlas allows you to connect to your cluster either with a driver for your favorite language (python, ...) or with the shell.

![connect to your cluster](./../img/connect_to_cluster.png)

## Connecting with Mongosh

Save the connection string in an environment variable

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_id>.mongodb.net/
```

For example

```sh
export MONGO_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_id>.mongodb.net/
```

Then connect with

```sh
mongosh ${MONGO_ATLAS_URI}
```

### Connecting in Python

We need the [pymongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) package

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

The connection string is

```python
connection_string = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<db_password>@<cluster_id>.mongodb.net
```

Note: If you work in python, it's better to put the connection string as an environment variable (`$MONGO_ATLAS_URI`), in a `.env` file. then load it with `dotenv`

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

MONGO_ATLAS_URI = os.getenv('MONGO_ATLAS_URI')
```

And then instantiate the client with

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient(MONGO_ATLAS_URI)
```

Once we have a client, we can connect to the database

```python
db = client["sample_mflix"]
```

then instantiate a collection

```python
collection = db["movies"]
```

The collection is of class `pymongo.synchronous.collection.Collection` and has many methods:

![many collections methods](./../img/collection_many_methods.png)

You cna then work directly in a python script file, in a Jupyter notebook (Google Colab, local) or in your terminal with [iPython](https://ipython.org).


### Using the terminal with `mongosh`

How to install `mongosh`: <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/>

The language used in the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`) is **JavaScript**.

`mongosh` is an interactive JavaScript interface for MongoDB, allowing you to interact with your MongoDB instances, execute queries or perform administrative tasks in JavaScript.

`mongosh` also supports many JavaScript features including the use of variables, loops and functions.

Here are some examples of using JavaScript in `mongosh`:

- **Connect to a MongoDB instance:**

Local

```sh
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

On Atlas

```sh
mongosh ${MONGO_ATLAS_URI}
```
where

```sh
export MONGO_ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_id>.mongodb.net/
```


Once connected to an instance

- **see the databases:**

```javascript
show dbs
```

returns

```sh
Atlas atlas-a12t6r-shard-0 [primary] test> show dbs
sample_mflix  126.52 MiB
songsdb        72.00 KiB
admin         348.00 KiB
local           3.20 GiB
```


- **Change database:**

```javascript
use sample_mflix
```

!! Attention !! If you try to use a database that does not exist, no error is raised.


- **see the collections:**

```javascript
show collections
```

- **db function**

![list of operations / methods on a database](./../img/mongosh_db-methods.png)

- **db.collection function**

![list of operations / methods on a collection](./../img/mongosh_db.collection-methods.png)


- **Insert a document**

```javascript
db.songs.insertOne(
    {
        "title": "Green Onions",
      "artist": "Booket T and the MGs",
      "year": 1967,
      "mood": "[blues, soul]"
  }
)
```

- **Update a document**

```js
db.users.updateOne(
{ "artist": "Booket T and the MGs" },
{ $set: { "artist": "Booker T and the MGs" } }
);
```

- **Query**

```javascript
db.songs.find({ year: { $lt: 2010 } })
```

- **Delete a document:**

```javascript
db.songs.deleteOne({ title: "Green Onions" })
```

- **Mongosh + Javascript**

Work with the whole javascript language in `mongosh`

You can set variables for instance

```javascript
var  max_year= 2010;
db.songs.find({ year: { $lt: max_year }})
```

- **execute scripts with mongosh**

```sh
mongosh < script.js
```

or

```sh
mongosh --file script.js
```

and within a mongosh session

```javascript
> load('path/to/script.js')
```

`mongosh` is a powerful tool for querying and managing your MongoDB databases.


Let's switch to the `sample_mflix` database.

```js
use sample_mflix
```

then
```js
show collections
```

### Difference between queries in python and javascript

python: double quotes around fields and operators

```python
db.movies.find(
    {"runtime": {"$gt" : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { "_id": 0, "title": 1, "runtime": 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

`mongosh`: no need for quotes

```js
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

## Filtering - query predicate

<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/>

The JSON clause that specifies the filtering arguments is called a **query predicate**.

A **query predicate** returns a boolean that indicates whether a document matches the specified query.

- An empty query predicate (`{ }`) returns all documents in the collection.

- `{ title: { $eq: "Top Gun" } }`, which returns documents that have a "`title`" field whose value is "`Top Gun`".


Main functions on collections

| function              | returns                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find()`              | all documents                                                                           |
| `find_one()`          | the 1st document                                                                        |
| `distinct("<field>")` | list of distinct values for the `<field>`                                               |
| `count_documents({})` | number of documents for the collection or returned by the filter in the query predicate |

Also note

- `find_one_and_replace()`
- `find_one_and_update()`
and

- `delete_many()`
- `delete_one()`
- `drop_index()`
- etc ...


You can chain these methods with `limit` and `sort`

```bash
db.movies.find({runtime: {$gt: 120}}).limit(3)
```

### Cursor

The result of a find query is a **cursor**.

```js
cursor = db.movies.find({})
```

A cursor is a pointer to a MongoDB query result set.

## Projection

In database language, **projecting** means selecting a subset of all possible fields.

In SQL, you simply list the column names

```sql
select genres, plot from movies;
```

In MongoDB, you must specify the fields in a JSON object, right after the query predicate

```js
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

Here the projection is expressed by: `({ _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 })`

- `title: 1`: includes the title field.
- `runtime: 1,` includes the runtime
- `"imdb.rating": 1`: Includes the `imdb.rating` field.
- `_id: 0`: Excludes the `_id` field from the result (the default value is 1 if not specified).

The query returns

```json
{ runtime: 240, title: 'Napoleon', imdb: { rating: 7.4 } },
{ runtime: 281, title: 'Les Mis√®rables', imdb: { rating: 7.9 } },
{ runtime: 245, title: 'Flash Gordon', imdb: { rating: 7.3 } },
{ runtime: 238, title: 'Gone with the Wind', imdb: { rating: 8.2 } },
...
```

### Number of documents

```js
db.movies.countDocuments({ "imdb.rating": { $gt: 8.0 } })
```

Notice how we  query the embedded fields : "imdb.rating"


### Your turn

Write the filter and projection for the following queries

- use projection to return only relevant fields or at minimum "title"
- limit results to 5 documents
- or return the number of documents with `db.movies.count_documents(filter)`

1. Find movies with an IMDb rating greater than 8
   - filter: `{"imdb.rating": {"$gt" : 8}}`
   - projection: `{"_id": 0, "title": 1, "imdb.rating": 1}`
2. Movies released after 2000
3. Movies with a specific director: "Christopher Nolan". Show title, director and year
4. Retrieve movies with `tomatoes.viewer.rating > 4.0`, showing title and viewer rating.
5. Find movies that contain `"Comedy"` and `"Drama"` in the `genres` array. Use `{$all: [list of genres]}`
6. Find movies that contain `"Comedy"` OR `"Drama"` in the `genres` array. Use `{$all: [list of genres]}`
7. Movie query on a year range: Retrieve movies released between 1990 and 2000, showing title and year.
8.  Movie query with **missing fields**: Find movies where the `fullplot` field does not exist. Use `$exists`.
9.  Find all **distinct** genres
   - use `db.movies.distinct("genres")`
10. top 5 most frequent genres
- use the `$unwind` operator in combination withe `$group` operator
```js
 {"$unwind": "$genres"},
 {"$group": {"_id": "$genres", "count": {"$sum": 1}}},
```


## Conclusion

In this session you practiced:

- Setting up MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted database service, including cluster creation and security configuration

- Writing basic MongoDB queries using JSON format:
  - Basic syntax: `{}` for all documents, `{field: value}` for equality, `{field: {$lt: value}}` for comparisons
  - How to query nested fields and arrays in complex documents

- Connecting to MongoDB Atlas using Python and `pymongo`:
  - Using basic operations: `find()`, `find_one()`, `distinct()`, `count_documents()`
  - Implementing projections to select specific fields

- Working with sample datasets (particularly the movies database) to practice:
  - Filtering and sorting data
  - Working with nested fields
  - Using operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$all`, `$exists`
  - Writing combined queries with multiple conditions

In the next session, we will dive deeper into MongoDB and look at more complex ways to query data using **aggregation pipelines**. We will also cover schema design and validation.
